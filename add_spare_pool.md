# Adding spare pools
{: #adding-spare-pools}

Spare pooling is a form of holding certain devices that are designated as spares and have the ability to take over the workflow of a primary device or act as a new device in the customer fleet. For a device to be designated as a spare, it must be added to the spare pool and associated to a primary device. Follow the steps below to add a device to the spare pool.
