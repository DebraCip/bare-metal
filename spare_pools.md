# Spare pools
{: #bm-about-spare-pools}

The Spare Pool screen in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} allows users to manage the spare pool of devices associated with the account. Each device in the spare pool can be used as a backup device in the event additional devices are needed. Devices must be designated as hot spares on the Spare Pool screen prior to being used in this process. The Spare Pool screen may only be accessed by users with specific permission.

## Before you begin
{: #bm-spare-pools-prereq}

Before you can use spare pools, contact IBM to have the Spare Pool and Spare Pool OS Reload attributes added to your account.
For an individual in your organization to gain permission to manage spare pools, please contact the account's administrator.

## Next Steps
{: #spare-pool-next}
Refer to [Accessing spare pools](/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-bm-access-spare-pools).
